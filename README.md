# Stations-Footfall-2024-2025
This project is based on the ‘Network demand’ open data published by the TfL website. The aim of this project was to identify trends and patterns within the data, make comparisons between variables i.e. stations, day of the week, zones, etc. , and derive insights that answer stakeholder driven questions and optimise performance.
